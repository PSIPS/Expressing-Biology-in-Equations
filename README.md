# For the Love of Biomathematics :)
After dreading maths as a subject for my entire life, I found meaning and pristine beauty in one of my undergrad courses- Biophysics. 
What drove me to do this, was the simplistic beauty of expressing a living system in an equation, suddenly the partial differentiations and various operators became a canvas for expressing the nuances of nature.

This is my ode to learning more of the beauty of Biology!
